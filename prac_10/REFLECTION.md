# Reflection
* My estimates for how long practicals will take were usually greater than the actual time. My accuracy of estimates did not improve during this course
* From having my code reviewed I have learned that I forget to write docstrings a lot. I have also learned that other people forget docstrings as well
* If I were in charge of the subject I would change nothing. It was a great student experience.
